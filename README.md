# Summation Calculator

This project calculates the sum of all numbers within a specified range and provides the option to save the results to a file. It ensures the input values are valid and allows multiple calculations in a single session.
The way I programmed this project was by setting up a simple loop to iterate through the range of numbers, summing them efficiently. Input validation was key to making sure the starting number is always less than the ending number. I also included an option to save the results to a text file, which required handling file operations carefully to store the computed sum in a structured format.

I built this project because I wanted to practice handling numerical operations and user input validation in a way that felt interactive. It was a fun challenge to ensure accuracy and efficiency while keeping the interface easy to use. Hopefully, it makes summation tasks quick and hassle-free for you.

## Example Output
```
--- Summation Calculator ---
Enter the starting number (a): 5
Enter the ending number (b): 10
The sum of all numbers between 5 and 10 is: 45
Results saved to 'summation_results.txt'.

Would you like to calculate another summation? (y/n): y
Enter the starting number (a): 12
Enter the ending number (b): 20
The sum of all numbers between 12 and 20 is: 144
Results saved to 'summation_results.txt'.

Would you like to calculate another summation? (y/n): n
Thank you for using the summation calculator!
